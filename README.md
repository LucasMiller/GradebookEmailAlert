# GradebookEmailAlert
MyOpenMath gradebook email alert system for use by the Haskell Indian Nations University
Department of Mathematics. 

The purpose of the this program is to:
-- automatically download a gradebook from MyOpenMath.com
-- parse it using Python
-- load all of the student information into an online database
-- email the Haskell Student Success Center when any number of conditions are 
   reached (e.g. a set number of absences, poor performance on the online homework, excessive lateness, etc...)
-- email the student that they have been referred to the student suceess center
-- update the database indicating that the student has been referred
-- when other conditions have been reached (pre-determined by the instructor, either in a config file or a GUI)
   the system will send the instructor an email letting them know which students need to be dropped from the 
   course for excessive absences.
